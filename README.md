# Identification of Neuro-Cognitive Markers of Sarcopenia Disease by Using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Artificial Intelligence Approach

Sarcopenia is a disease characterized by decreased muscle mass and function, especially in elderly populations. Studies in recent years revealed that decreased muscle function in sarcopenia is a more effective marker to determine the negative effects of the disease, independent of muscle mass. Therefore, the function of the central nervous system in sarcopenia has become an important research topic. On the other hand, when the relationship between sarcopenia and cognitive function was revealed by behavioral tests in previous studies, understanding the relationship between this disease and neurological reflections of cognitive functions emerged as a critical research question.

In this project, we will try to observe the differences between the motor and cognitive functions of sarcopenia patients and healthy controls using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and we will try to reveal the neurological markers of sarcopenia using artificial intelligence techniques from the features that will be extracted from fNIRS signals. Our project aims to;

- Design three block design experiments, one of which is motor function and the other two cognitive functions as attention and working memory in computer environment and apply to the participants and to measure the hemodynamic response to be acquired with the fNIRS system simultaneously
- Analyze the experimentally acquired fNIRS signals with both conventional statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques,
- Statistically associate the hemodynamic response-based cortical markers obtained with these methods with clinical findings and to reveal the relationship between cognitive findings and motor function findings.

The aspects of our project proposal that will provide original value and unique contribution can be explained as follows;
- Sarcopenia is a disease of muscle strength loss related to aging in general. However, its neurological markers are not yet fully known. In our project, these markers will be revealed with an approach focused on functional neuroimaging.
- The relationship of this disease with cognitive functions has been demonstrated only by clinical tests. In our project, to reveal the relationship of sarcopenia with specific functions such as memory and attention, with an approach focused on functional neuroimaging, which is an objective criterion.

Although the outputs to be obtained at the end of our project are thought to lead to areas to be targeted in the development of drug therapy in sarcopenia, where there is no drug therapy yet, neuro-cognitive findings will give researchers an idea about other cognitive functions and their neurological reflections, which will be focused on in future studies in sarcopenia disease.
